## What is this?

Subtitles extracted from some vidoes using Amazon Transcribe.

## Info

Subtitles are the in `.srt` format. Each video directory has two sub directories: `cleaned` and `raw`.
`raw` contains subtitles purely generated from Amazon Transcribe. Amazon Transcribe does a pretty good,
but has probably about 80% accuracy, with this seeming to decrease if words are being sung.

`cleaned` contains the same subtitles, but cleaned up, missing or naively applied transcriptions
are replaced, additional context is added etc. This is a work in progress and subject to change.
