0
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:13,080
All right now. I know business has been a bit slow lately. Yes, it's no one's fault.

1
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,720
Okay. I'm not naming any names here, Moxxie now.

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,490
Does anyone have any bright ideas on how we can get business drumming up again.

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,370
What about a car wash? This is Hell, Millie. No one cares about cars being clean here.

4
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:30,940
Okay. What about a billboard? We can't afford a billboard, sir. [Blitzo] Helpful, Moxxie.

5
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,030
Really glad you're in the room right now.

6
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,510
Have you guys forgotten what service we provide?

7
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,090
That was one of the good times. I don't need any reminding sir.

8
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:51,160
Considering you blew most of our salaries on an obnoxious tv ad last week. One that you

9
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,010
then additionally paid to have run for a

10
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,400
full three hours on a channel nobody watches.

11
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,540
Hey, excuse me. What's obnoxious about a super fun jingle? All right.

12
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,930
It's a fun distraction when an advertisement spitting bullshit.

13
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:09,560
People love musicals, sir. Exactly, Millie and we're basically doing a musical.

14
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,560
Are you going to crush my musical theater dreams like my dad did,

15
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,230
sir?

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,550
Because right now all I see is just my dad's asshole talking

17
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,050
to me crushing my dreams of being who I truly am inside.

18
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,220
Are you trying to crush his dreams, Moxxie?

19
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:23,760
I

20
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,480
...what? I thought I knew you. [Blitzo] I can't believe you

21
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,720
Moxxie after I made you employee of the month.

22
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:31,860
Okay, sir,

23
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,430
I'm sorry, a commercial jingle is not comparable to musical theater?

24
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,060
Nobody actually likes the jingles. [Mille] I liked it.

25
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,850
Do not do not agree with him in front of me.

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,530
Hi there. I'm Blitzo! The O is silent and I'm the founder of I. M. P.

27
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,870
Are you a piece of shit who got yourself sent to Hell? Are you an innocent soul?

28
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,100
Who got fucked over by someone else? 

29
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,870
After lovingly killing my wife for fucking a delivery man.

30
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,050
You can imagine my surprise when I wound up here after the state of Ohio killed me.

31
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,770
I really wish I could stick it to that yappy jogger who saw me hiding the body.

32
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,390
Well, luckily for you, thanks to our company's special access to the living world.

33
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,800
We can help you take care of your unfinished

34
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,540
business by taking out anyone who screwed you over

35
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,680
when you were alive. [*jingle*] When you want somebody gone and you don't want to wait too long.

36
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,160
[*jingle*] Call the immediate murder professionals

37
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,880
[*jingle*] Hand grenade or cynanide, we'll make it look like suicide. The

38
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,170
[*jingle*] immediate murder professionals. We do our jobs

39
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,630
[*jingle*] so well, because we go straight up from Hell

40
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,120
[*jingle*] We'll kill your husband or your wife. We'll even let you keep the knife!

41
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:41,960
Mhm.

42
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:50,800
Doctor. He's not responding. More water, stat! It didn't do anything.

43
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,560
Damn it. I'm not losing another one.

44
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,860
Holy shit. It actually worked.

45
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,480
He appears to be in stable condition, but he'll need surgery.

46
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,660
What insurance provider do you freaks have?

47
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,870
The fuck is insurance?

48
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,460
...kids die for free!

49
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,610
I'd like to go on record and say that incident was Loona's fault,

50
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,980
dispatch is supposed to give us the right info on the target.

51
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:33,260
It's very simple. Oh, sit on a dick, Moxxie. You sit sit on a...

52
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:39,300
and then do your job. Now we don't blame our screwups on Loona. Okay.

53
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:47,160
She didn't do anything wrong? Are you kidding me sir? She's awful. I

54
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,460
Hello, I.M.P. (phone) What if I got stabbed?!

55
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:56,950
Happy adoption anniversary loony. I got you a little something.

56
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,570
Is it a cure for syphilis?

57
00:03:59,140 --> 00:03:59,560
I...

58
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,250
Then I don't want it!

59
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:12,850
I'm sorry, my spiders. Goddammit. Excuse me. Did you just fax me an ad for weight loss?

60
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,060
No why why would anyone send me this? Come on.

61
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,360
You know why

62
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,720
whoever left the fucking avocado salad in the fridge?

63
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,810
I'm taking it because I have the worst hangover right now.

64
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,610
Why would you drink on a work night? I'm hungover from this morning dumb ass.

65
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,650
Isn't that my lunch? You know what?

66
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,180
I can't take this assault right now I need to blow off some fucking steam

67
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:44,860
That clingy rich asshole is on the phone says it's urgent, wants to talk to you.

68
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,750
Sounds a little D. T. F. Oh God it was one time

69
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,820
if I hadn't slept with that privileged asshole.

70
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,950
None of us would have access to the living world.

71
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,360
You what?

72
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,560
Got the book, Got the book.

73
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:07,370
Not this fucking heavy book. Oh shit

74
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,720
sorry I fucked your husband. How hard you already know what can I do you for?

75
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,090
This time stole us.

76
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,690
There's a political candidate causing trouble upon

77
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,780
earth for a few of my associates.

78
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,850
He's trying to convince people global warming exists. (Blitzo) Doesn't it?

79
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,460
Well yes but more people die if nothing is done about it

80
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,460
and it gets lonely here.

81
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,490
Okay, well um yeah, that makes sense.

82
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,020
You know what happens when I'm lonely, Blitzy. (Blitzo) God fucking dammit.

83
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:42,620
When I'm lonely, I become hungry and when I become hungry,

84
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,640
I want to choke on that [***]

85
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,860
of yours

86
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:46,940
[***]

87
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,450
and lick all of your

88
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,600
before taking out your [***]

89
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,960
and [***] with more teeth until you're screaming

90
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,360
[***] like a fucking baby

91
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,470
eat this.

92
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,680
And then you know that bridge over the freeway? Yeah, shit off it.

93
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,930
Look, the point is,

94
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:15,010
Loona is a valued member of our family and we don't get rid of family.

95
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,090
We aren't a family sir, you are the boss,

96
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,390
we are the employees. You treat her like she's some troubled teenager,

97
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,100
she's more like a meth, addicted homeless woman.

98
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,800
You let man the phones. That is offensive.

99
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:33,460
Without homeless people, I wouldn't have half the joy and laughter I do in this life.

100
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,260
Mhm.

101
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,450
What?

102
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,350
While we're on the subject of family,

103
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,110
can you stop finding me and Millie outside of work?

104
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,160
Come on, sweetie, It's not that big a deal. Excuse me? What

105
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,960
honey, can you give me the butter

106
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,460
sir, sweetie! Spoiler alert. The butter spoiled.

107
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:58,250
What's funny honey. Really impressive wordplay. What? Why are you in our fridge?

108
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,360
Oh

109
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:09,300
what you're dreaming about?

110
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:14,760
I was dreaming my parents were being murdered, but now I'd like to go back to that

111
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:20,160
of all the instant Hell it's for him that I am. Oh mill

112
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:21,540
yeah,

113
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:28,300
are you fucking filming us right now? Just stop doing that.

114
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,000
I don't see what the issue is there something you don't want me seeing?

115
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,870
Know your baby Weiner?

116
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:38,650
Haver, sir, what you say and how you act as totally inappropriate, calm down Mox.

117
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:43,760
You're going to have another panic attack. (Moxxie) I am calm! There, there.

118
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:48,170
Look, I don't judge the boring couple stuff you do outside work hours,

119
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,890
so don't judge me for what I do.

120
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,570
Judge you, sir. Quite a lot actually. Mox, he's our boss. No, it's fine Mills.

121
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:01,060
Your husband is just...how do I say this? Without being offensive...retarded?

122
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,680
Does immaturely insulting me? Make you feel better about your sad single life.

123
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,520
It actually does. The only reason you have a wife is because you're easy to manage.

124
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:15,560
No, he's not! You bitch! (Blitzo) Do not talk to my receptionist that way. She's sensitive.

125
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,610
Yes, I am. You guys are all fucking assholes.

126
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,240
Yeah.

127
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,100
Oh, shut up, kid. You're lucky to witness this.

128
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:28,030
This company is such a mess. All right, let's get back to talking about my outfit.

129
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,050
Nobody was talking about that. Which is why I'm trying to get that ball rolling.

130
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,340
So how does it look? It's good. Right.

131
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,250
It's been a literal Hell having to pretend to be paralyzed.

132
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,960
You fuck shits wouldn't kill me. But now I want that. I want death.

133
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,840
You are a selfish, greedy clown and I'm a kid.

134
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:47,360
We're supposed to like clowns, even the creepy ones.

135
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,090
Hey, now that's not very... (kid) If I wanted to hear from a spineless jackass,

136
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,450
I'd rip out your spine and ask you some shit.

137
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:58,130
That's my husband you're talking to! *laughs* That's your husband?!

138
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,960
I figured you for a slut, but I didn't know you needed dick that bad

139
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:09,250
And you. [Loona] What? What about me? Nothing. I don't talk to dogs. I'm a cat person.

140
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:10,540
Yeah,

141
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,350
...wow. You know, kid, you kind of are a piece of shit.

142
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,500
Oh fuck guys. I just got a text from our client.

143
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,350
I guess he was the right target after all.

144
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,960
Who him? Me, yep. They wanted us to kill an actual child. That's what they're saying.

145
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,760
Well, Christ on a stick. I guess there is a God,

146
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,520
You know, folks with this company,

147
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:38,310
I really wanted to prove that we're capable of doing

148
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:42,160
the same things anyone else can. Like killing people.

149
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,640
So from us here at the Immediate Murder Professionals Group,

150
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:49,710
we promised to settle your unfinished business or your money is gone and

151
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,550
you're never getting it back and you can write us a bad review,

152
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,760
but we'll play dumb to it because it's Hell and no one fucking cares.

153
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,660
You know, even though this kid was a target,

154
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,550
he's still a child,

155
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,520
It's important that we've handled this going forward respectfully.

156
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:08,280
Please. If anyone has seen my little Eddie, please contact us.

157
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:09,860
Oh,

158
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,760
you're welcome.

159
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:21,390
Oh, what a thrill when the crimson starts to spill and my Millie goes in for the kill,

160
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,640
she takes away my breath.

161
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:32,250
She's the angel of death for me. Oh Millie, she's McQueen. It's like a dream

162
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:41,110
when I hear her victims start to scream in and out of the sack. She's the maniac for me.

163
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,640
Oh Millie!

164
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:49,670
When the blood starts dripping down the walls and the bodies start to fall,

165
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,150
my heart skipped a beat

166
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,940
when my Millie's guns a blazing in the heat.

167
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:05,780
My assassin love, She makes the murdering fun for me. A lottery of all the incident.

168
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:09,350
Hell it's for her that I fell Omilami

169
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,260
mm
