00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:08,760
I was a good person before it all went down I was good my entire life.

1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,360
Mm

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,790
Good morning.

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,880
I hope you all did your homework,

4
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,930
we did your homework and you have our teachers and then when I

5
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,830
threw out these fun questions you should notice what to do to plus 60

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,150
and good behavior and it's now that part of the class when we

00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,630
say the time of day and date nine in the morning on january 8th

8
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,140

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,600
Oh my stars

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,360
stop singing Children hush up now,

15
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:59,020
I forgot it's my husband's birthday. I didn't get him anything special.

16
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:04,190
If we call him we could do a happy birthday surprise. Okay yeah,

17
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:08,210
we're not your things right there. Oh yeah,

18
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,530
okay. Not there, not there, not there.

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:21,750
Okay wait this is me buried. Remember what you taught us. Think before you act.

20
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,050
Mhm

21
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:29,750
Mhm

22
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:37,860
Okay. Oh shit, sweetie! What are you doing here? Shut up carol!

23
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,350
You scream like a thick

24
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:47,860
Oh God, what have you done? She had a family. We could have had his family.

25
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,350
Oh dear God. What have I done

26
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,350
in front of you all?

27
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,590
I'm so sorry my Children don't forget to work on your time stable.

28
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,570
You do everything right in life.

29
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,630
Played by all the rules and still get sent down here with all

30
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,620
the Hitler's at Epstein's of the world after one measly massacre propelled by.

31
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,060
Blind rage. So that's why I'm here

32
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,560
to get my revenge. I mean was she hotter?

33
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,660
I'm just saying I had a hard time understanding the unprompted melodrama,

34
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,050
you just spat at me tits anyway,

35
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,720
I don't think you quite understand how we're operating down here.

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,900
See we take revenge out on the living and it sounds like the core cast of

37
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,630
your sitcom of a death frankly are all probably down here in hell with you.

38
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,420
Not all of them That horse survived now. They all call her a hero.

39
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,060
How does it feel to have survived such a crazy bitch.

40
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:51,390
I just hope that sick woman finally found pace. You are so brave. Here's $2 million.

41
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,050
Oh thank you

42
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,130
between the talk shows and donation bullshit. She made so much goddamn cash.

43
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:04,810
Getting shot was the best thing to happen to her. You're a hero. You're a hero girl.

44
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:11,220
My mom was a hero. She is a hero. Your hero. Your

45
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,460
hero. Your Oh

46
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,160
okay.

47
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:22,060
Oh you're a hero. She's not a oh yeah, okay. Yeah. My thoughts exactly

48
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,650
moxie stop shaking. You're gonna shoot are only hail ham, wow. I feel so loved here.

49
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,200
Just take a deep breath and let it out.

50
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:43,410
But it's a family under what circumstances would we ever need to kill a human family?

51
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,850
I mean if that's what the client wants, maybe like a shitty dad or a mob family

52
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:54,180
that's understandable but to eradicate an entire innocent,

53
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,780
seemingly in this instance.

54
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,640
Upper middle class family bloodline. Hey you don't know they're innocent.

55
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,880
This kid probably sets dogs on fire.

56
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:07,150
Maybe this girl gets off to bullying Australian kids online. And this guy.

57
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:13,160
This guy definitely watches Exactly. Humans are full of secret nasties.

58
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,190
It's why so many of them end up here.

59
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,540
But guilty and innocent aren't our business mocks.

60
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:22,560
Killing who were paid to is our business shoot the target.

61
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,270
I just think it's a bit excessive and we could be a bit more selective. Is all dance.

62
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,980
I want you to meet

63
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,850
our newest client.

64
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,060
It's

65
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,250
damn it, moxie, I just cross those heels.

66
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,670
Bye.

67
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:51,960
And don't worry, we'll get that skank in less than 24 hours or your first kill is free.

68
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,650
When did we start implementing that deal?

69
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:59,410
When you set fire to my office in front of a quiet, you fucking Dick Shit.

70
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,220
Now someone please tell me that fancy book is still intact.

71
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:07,430
You mean our only ticket to the other side? Yeah, got it.

72
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:14,780
And that's why you're my favorite Looney. You get a tweet now, stop, you're so gross.

73
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:19,740
Oh, stop it. I got enough of that from my therapist. Now let's go lick some ass.

74
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,030
The expression is kick some ass blitz. Mine's better.

75
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,060
Fuck!

76
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:26,540
Yeah,

77
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,550
that's gotta be her. Oh, this is too easy

78
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,750
moxie. Do you want this one? Me?

79
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:34,700
Yeah.

80
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,760
This one simple enough for you to handle just a

81
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,960
happy mother who just got out of the hospital.

82
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,620
You snooze, You lose marks and I got you bitch.

83
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,980
Wait, are we actually killing a family. No, don't be a puss.

84
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,360
We're just killing a mother were ruining a family. But

85
00:05:52,940 --> 00:06:01,550
hold on, hold on. Let's just think about. What was that ralphie? I don't know Martha.

86
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,760
But whatever it is,

87
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,760
they're gonna be tomorrow night's dinner.

88
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:08,650
Mm.

89
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:17,350
All right, kids, guns out. Looks like he got some rabbits to catch young'uns.

90
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,860
What the fuck was that, moxie?

91
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,860
I'm sorry. They just seem so wholesome and happy. I panicked.

92
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,140
Who the fuck is innocent moxie from the moment of birth. You already?

93
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,930
A parasite leeching off your mama's kids.

Yeah.

101
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,550
A little critter.

102
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,450
You can't hide long for me.

103
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,460
Mhm.

104
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,160
Okay.

00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,350
Oh,

114
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,300

00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:38,730
Yeah.

117
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:44,940
Uh huh.

118
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,160
I know.

119
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,260
Little day.

120
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:58,550
I promise. I can make that pain go real quick. Just come, let me know my Marsa.

121
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,450
Put a bullet in your pretty little scout.

122
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,260
Okay.

123
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,460
Damn it.

124
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:11,660
This is a really bad time. When isn't it? At that time? Let's see. What is it?

125
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,280
I've been meaning to follow up in our

126
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,780
last little conversation regarding my grim watch.

127
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,960
What did you just call me? My book?

128
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:23,960
Let's see the book I was given to do my job that I have allowed you to use to do yours.

129
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:31,410
Can hear you darling. Shit. Any who I have been thinking.

130
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:36,820
You know, I have been permitting you to access the mortal realm less than legally.

131
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,260
For some time now but I do need it back to fulfill my duties. I was thinking

132
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,780
what if we worked out some kind of exchange favors for favors?

133
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,500
Doesn't that sound enticing? You gotta stop using your fancy ass rich people talk.

134
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,450
Okay I'm trying to concentrate on not getting fucked in my age.

135
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,730
Then let me keep it simple once a month on the full moon.

136
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:04,220
You return the book to me followed by a night of Pershing good for

137
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:09,380
location and you get to keep it all the rest of the time.

138
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:15,620
Sound fair. My little imp fine whatever. Oh blitz. I'm so excited.

139
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,840
I cannot wait to feel your slimy

140
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,650

141
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,240

Mm.

146
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:40,740

00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:44,650
Mm.

149
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,230
Yeah.

150
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,140
Yeah.

151
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,140
Yeah.

152
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,540
Yeah.

153
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,250
Mhm.

154
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,260
Yeah

155
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,680
I had that fucking shot.

156
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:11,670
Goddammit moxie satan, we return your filthy creatures back to the pits of hell.

157
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,460
May the root of evil remain honored as we continue my work.

158
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:18,960
Yeah.

159
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:21,650
Okay.

160
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:23,860
Yeah.

161
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,140
Yeah.

162
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,480
Yeah that's not exactly how it works lady.

163
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,500
Sorry your fire doesn't really hurt us but I mean

164
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,530
I could fake it if that'll get your dick hard.

165
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,060
Oh

166
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,200
shit.

167
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:42,070
Well I'll just shoot you in your smart ass mouth. That would be more effective blitz.

168
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,750
You're not getting your goddamn paycheck for this one box.

169
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:54,520
Yeah,

170
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,040
yeah.

171
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,600
Oh yeah, Thanks. I'm fine. I'm sorry sir.

172
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,760
I compromised our objective and put us in harm's way.

173
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,030
It won't happen again. I promise, apology accepted.

174
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,110
But if you ever pull a stunt like this again, I will fuck you and your wife.

175
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:18,460
