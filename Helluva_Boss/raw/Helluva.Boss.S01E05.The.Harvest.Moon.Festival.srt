0
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,950
Uh huh.

1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,260
Mm hmm.

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,080
I'm sorry for having to move our little rendezvous early.

3
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,470
I have an engagement this month on the full moon when this happens.

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,350
It's not really something I fuss about.

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,960
But do you really need the book for this farm bullshit?

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,400
I have like 15 new clients waiting for heads to roll.

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,300
As shocking as it may seem glitzy.

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,750
My grim wa is actually incredibly important and it isn't supposed

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,710
to be lent out to depict the intent like yourself.

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,880
The harvest moon is a very special occasion.

11
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,520
It's been my annual duty to showcase it in the ring of Wrath.

12
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:49,400
It's celebrated by a very charming little festival with the locals Wrath, huh?

13
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,600
My employees are from there. I've never really been here.

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,960
It's full of inbred chuckle. Fucks. Oh, why don't you all join me at the festival?

15
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:03,340
I can guarantee you all special excess. Look, I told you we're not bodyguards. Okay.

16
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:08,960
That was a one time thing we did badly. I'm simply offering a work free day of fun.

17
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,970
I feel quite safe at the harvest festival. It's the same every year.

18
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,560
Well, if you promise, this isn't some fuck fest invite.

19
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,420
It does sound like it could be a blast and a half plus.

20
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,570
It's not like we can do Jack shit without your book anyway. I'm sorry.

21
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,760
Your clients who have to wait. Oh, fuck my clients.

22
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,360
Really?

23
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,470
What do you want sir? Hey, hope I didn't wake. You mocks.

24
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,840
How would you and mills want to visit the

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,920
Wrath ring for some harvest bullshit this year?

26
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,060
The harvest moon festival. You

27
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,550
fuck it all. Well, Milly likes the idea.

28
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,560
Wait,

29
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,850
where are you calling from? Mm?

30
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,290
Of course

31
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,460
you can do that.

32
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,740
Uh huh

33
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,960
Oh,

34
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:10,110
daddy. Hell's my deadly little pumpkin spice. Do it. I'm good pop.

35
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,170
Thanks for letting us stay here for the harvest jamboree. It's no trouble.

36
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,250
We know you aren't making as much anymore

37
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,790
since y'all went freelance freelance pays fine mom.

38
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,660
We're doing fine. It's fine.

39
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,760
Anyway, y'all remember? My husband might see

40
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,550
readings win joe.

41
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,800
How have you been with all the flaming twisters and stuff around here?

42
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:43,330
We lost our old farm head to one of them payrolls last week. Oh, crumbs my bad.

43
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,220
I am so sorry. I didn't mean to open that wound

44
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,130
sir. Hey, watch it. I'm the sir here, bucko. Yeah.

45
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:55,630
Y'all haven't met my boss blitz and his hellhound. I'm not just his hellhound.

46
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,360
Yeah, she's my daughter. Only on paper.

47
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,590
Y'all don't deserve to know my name.

48
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,650
It's a pleasure to finally meet the sperm and egg

49
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,350
factory that popped out this little gem of an assassin.

50
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,160
You to raised a sturdy bitch

51
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:16,910
that we did. So glitches it there. That's a fine name. It reminds me of war.

52
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,980
Uh, nothing like a little war to make a strong man. I like you.

53
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:27,260
People, you know more battles were won by technological advances in warfare.

54
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,940
I've researched the history of weaponry extensively and it's inspiring.

55
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,010
How, for example,

56
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,630
the progression of guns utilizing angelic technology

57
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,000
has changed the landscape of hell's combative.

58
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,020
I mean, we're fun guns get the job done.

59
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,490
But a man ain't nothing if he can't hear the

60
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,410
head off a hellish beast with only his bare hands

61
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,760

00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,260

Well, howdy!

65
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,899
Oh, lookee! Here, you must be the famous mildred.

66
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,310
Heard some good things about you from your folks. Little lady.

67
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:27,540
What are y'all doing so far away from em city? A free working finally slowing down.

68
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,960
Oh no, freelance. He's in free. It's a

69
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,060
never mind.

70
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,970
We're just visiting for the festival. The prince is our boss's boss. Friend Millie.

71
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:43,510
I am not above hitting a female in front of her daddy boss, Huh?

72
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:47,260
Oh, So you're the bold attempt to start his own killing biz? Yeah.

73
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,250
Well, when you're good at something, you should probably capitalize not many.

74
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,160
Start businesses on their own.

75
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,750
That's pretty impressive sir. Oh

76
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,360
yeah, it is. I guess.

77
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,970
I guess it is, isn't it?

78
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,140
So you even con that ditzy blue blood into getting you to the surface.

79
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:08,100
Well, it's long and complicated, but the short answer is yes, but he's not like,

80
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,440
you know, we're not we're not doing it.

81
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,790
What's between?

82
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,850
It's a transactional fucking you see, you know,

83
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,660
you boys should enter the pain games.

84
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,800
I heard games. What games? I'm in every harvest festival.

85
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:26,250
There's a competition to be the roughest toughest bastard and ram. Yeah.

86
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,600
I wish I could play millie. You know, you get too carried away.

87
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,160
The last competition ended in 15 separate funerals, I'm aware.

88
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,780
But I only cause none of them. How come Sallie Mae still gets to compete.

89
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,640
Your sister doesn't have a neighborhood head care.

90
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:47,920
She so does it doesn't can if they don't find the body still,

91
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,020
you get to root for her and your brothers and now you can cheer on your boss.

92
00:05:52,030 --> 00:06:00,310
You know, she can also cheer for me. Way you. Yeah, I could compete, can't I?

93
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,520
Third boy. But I don't think sensitive sp in types would last very long in the games.

94
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,340
I was born here too. I have some fight in me, huh?

95
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,920
Well in little fella,

96
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:17,960
won't you help me wrangle one of them hogs for dinner. Simple. Watch me with these

97
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,000
bullets can pierce the shell. You gotta get the knot underneath them.

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,960
Pry yourself an opening. Oh right, right.

99
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,020
I knew that. Just remember your rep with the in laws is on the line here.

100
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,150
So no pressure at all.

101
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,470
You totally will not make an ass of yourself

102
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,060
in front of everyone important in your life.

103
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,080
Go get them tiger. Oh mok. You don't need to do this.

104
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,460
Oh, he totally does take a class moxie. Yes.

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,560
Up.

Oh, I am always down to skin the manly. Meet with the manly man. That's what she said.

116
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:36,060

117
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:41,760
Don't let him get to you And hey, you don't need my parents to respect you.

118
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,260
They will eventually. No, they won't.

00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,960

What? Yeah. I asked him if he wants to join I. M. P.

You asked.

00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,600
Mr?

171
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,500
You are aware this kind of weapon can kill demon royalty.

172
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,120
Yes, that

173
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,150
no shit.

174
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,960
That's kind of the point.

175
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:32,970
Okay, well, I'm relatively concerned by your possession of this.

176
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,160
I'm also glad my instant dislike of you has been validated.

177
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,160
Yeah.

178
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,760
Uh huh.

179
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:42,700
Yeah.

180
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,150
Mhm.

181
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:46,850
Mhm.

182
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:51,750
Good.

183
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:55,950
Yeah.

184
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,050
Uh huh.

185
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,460
Oh.

186
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,660
Mhm,

187
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,490
pathetic.

188
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,250
Mhm.

189
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,860
Mellie.

190
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,240
I'd kill you all,

191
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,940
but I feel like there's more leverage with your rodeo clown of a boss.

192
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,860
If I don't

193
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,450
Plus your little things ain't worth to clean up

194
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,300
millie.

195
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,650
I'm satan moxie. I'm fine.

196
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,760
I got worse than this during the flower toughs in my brother's wedding.

197
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,300
But I call that fucking bouquet and it was fucking worth it.

198
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:56,740
You just have to get out there and fuck up that brown nosing cocksucker for me,

199
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,660
but I can't break through it.

200
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:03,760
I'm not strong enough. Not with your hands, baby. Use what you're good at.

201
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,620
I'm not good with my hands.

202
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,750
Oh right.

203
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,850
Yeah. Yeah.

204
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,500
I probably should have used this earlier. Uh huh. I love you honey.

205
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:25,360
But for fuck's sake, my dear communist of the Ring of Rock. I

206
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,320
stole us of the arms. Go Alicia

207
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:35,190
here by curse this year's harvest with the globe of the true harvest moon.

208
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:48,570
Excuse me the fuck Liz. I thought you were still at the ceremony.

209
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,800
You thought I wanted to stand around with a bunch of hillbillies

210
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,460
excited about corn and shit with a thirsty owl on stage.

211
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,740
Now you seem disappointed in me.

212
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,790
Yeah, well,

213
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,340
I'm not a fan of someone I offered a job

214
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:03,510
to about two off my easiest lengthy ticket to earth,

215
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,150
bind my back lists.

216
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:05,760
Come on.

217
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,300
You know, the two of us are superior than most of our kind.

218
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:15,140
And you were so above sucking on a disgusting rich pompous Croatia

219
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,790
only to sneak topside for scraps and work for bitter centers.

220
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,960
Who could care less who you are when you could be slaying overlords.

221
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,820
Why struggle to run a business that is rigged against you.

222
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,340
You could partner up with me and kill

223
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,580
the unkillable.

224
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:35,160
Starting with the one that treats you like a play thing. That's kind of hot.

225
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,220
We could be the most dangerous beans in hell.

226
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:43,160
Let's wow, that was a good fucking pitch in workshop in it.

227
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,270
You know what? Fuck it

228
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,260
I'm in.

229
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,060
Uh huh.

230
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:55,390
Took you long enough marks. Well you should have seen your dipshit thing. What?

231
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,660
Bull? Okay, cliche much.

232
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,550
Oh you daddy fucker.

233
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:03,650
Mhm

234
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,060
Yeah.

235
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:07,950
Oh

236
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,260
yeah

237
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,340
you dumb. Fucks lost the upper hand fast. Huh?

238
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:18,260
You seem to have forgotten something. Fuck Oh.

239
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,450
Mhm.

240
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,850
A fucking dammit luna. It's a damn shame blitz.

241
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,850
We might actually have made a good team.

242
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,560
Not well. And your wet dreams, you hockey talk.

243
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,250
Mhm

244
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,310
I still think it's embarrassing.

245
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,270
You're wasting a lot of potential, relying on a week list.

246
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,680
You're gonna finish that fucking sentence.

247
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,450
Hardener vermin

248
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,860
who's weak now. Big, okay, I'm here.

249
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,950
Maybe you'll get me next time.

250
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,190
Let's see.

251
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:14,950
Mhm

252
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:17,550
Mhm.

253
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,990
I can't believe you let him trap you really haven't. We talked you better.

254
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,720
I was seeing Red Ma and he was slavery excuses. You're better than that mildred.

255
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,250
You know she protected

256
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,950
and maybe I'm not a strong beefy dickhead.

257
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,310
But Millie has the strength enough for both of us.

258
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,660
You two are getting on her case about being hurt by a psychopath. You hired

259
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:49,400
shame on you. Oh moxie, look at you speech and like a big boy with his big pants,

260
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:59,030
wow! He noted. He's never acknowledged your input before. So is that progress

261
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,670
uh failed to kill the target at the festival.

262
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,460
But don't worry, ma'am,

263
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:13,900
it won't happen again. It's better not. I want this cheating prick dead.

264
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:18,560
I don't care who you have to go through. Make it happen,

265
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,660
understood.

266
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:26,960
I'll get him next time.

267
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,560
Sweet.

268
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,920
Everything. I

269
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:47,170
every talent type so much more talented than you, every time I try

270
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:52,270
push it and succeed me.
