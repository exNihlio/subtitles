00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:15,060
livia is calling a Stella. Here you get up.

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,250
Fear. What troubles you? My our let

4
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,260
daddy,

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,750
Daddy.

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,160
I had a dream. A really bad dream.

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,390
A nightmare. I was looking all over the palace

8
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,360
and I couldn't find you anywhere.

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,150
He was there

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,110
there there via It's okay. You're okay

11
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,120
when you're scared

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,560
and you don't know where I am. You must remember.

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,010
No matter what happens to me,

14
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:53,230
I will never be far away from my special little starfire.

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:01:04,560
It always seems more quiet in the dark. It always feels so star.

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:16,160
How silence grows under the moon, constellations gone so soon.

17
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:26,550
I used to think that I was bowled. I used to think love would be fun.

18
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,860
Now my stories have been told

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,660
except for one

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,540
as the stars start to

21
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:48,590
I hope you take it as a sign.

22
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:57,750
Okay. Everything will be OK.

23
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:13,850
And ever seven rains go lattes. Although the day could be my last. You will be okay

24
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:19,060
when I'm gone. Be okay.

25
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,380
And when creation goes to

26
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:37,890
you can find in the sky upon the lost. You will be

27
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,300

28
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:52,580
a fucking bath. It wasn't expected. I didn't have time to go to the hotel

29
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,250
like a fucking plebian.

30
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,350
The world is burning down around here.

31
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:04,340

Security for a theme park. We're rich and we're hot.

Only me and my crew are not here to satisfy your perverted bird means All right,

75
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,060

78
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,290

I knew today would be a lot. What do you need? And

82
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,450
I'll be broke into morphine. That was figurative old man. Oh right.

83
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,150
But she said it was literally

84
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:24,860
what?

85
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,030
I haven't been to this place since I was a,

86
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,760
it hasn't changed a bit.

87
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:40,880
Oh, it's a big move lee that is deeply upsetting. Oh, come on. It's fun.

88
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:41,960
You've never been here.

89
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:42,850
No

90
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,960
theme parks always disturbed me.

91
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:52,140
Especially the mascots. Well, hey there, I'm lulu. Welcome to lulu land.

92
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:58,310
If you all get hurt here, just try and sue us. Look here, it's lulu. I have a question.

93
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,770
We'll ask away. Little girly

94
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,390
isn't true.

95
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,910
This park is just a really shameless spinoff

96
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,850
of Lucifer's far more popular lulu world.

97
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,660
No, this place reeks of insecure corporate shame.

98
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,230
Why don't we go check out the rides? That shakes creepy.

99
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,440
Wait till her dad tries to diddle your holes. What's that mean? Don't talk to me.

100
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,260
I know you're a pervert under there.

101
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,040
Yeah.

102
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,620
You really like this place. Huh? I love this place.

103
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,180
My parents would bring me and my siblings here when they could swing it

104
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,350
money wise. Yeah. The prices do seem rather crimen.

105
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:45,660
I mean that much for a novelty cup that you use one time because it's lulu land.

106
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,630
Listen to your home marks

107
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:54,410

Yeah.

178
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,460
Oh, what a mouth?

179
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,940
Many people

180
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:04,720
God Joey knife in. You ruined another body photo. Why were you even born Octavia?

181
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,700
Leave me alone. Octavia.

182
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:21,160
Um, I think I'm supposed to be body guarded right now.

183
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,600
God, that's better. But where is glitzy? He's my knight in shining armor.

184
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,860
Not you littler ones. He's up.

185
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,660
Big thing being a fool. What kind of fool? Everything is now on fire. Kind.

186
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,240
Yeah,

187
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,560
yeah,

188
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:43,840
yeah.

189
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,560
Octavia.

190
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,260
I take it you of

191
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,550
not having fun.

192
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,700
I didn't even want to come here. I'm sorry sweetie. I

193
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,160
thought you loved it here.

194
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:57,750
Mhm

195
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,960
And I was a kid and my parents didn't hate each other.

196
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,890
My dad didn't feel it was a weird red decade the entire time.

197
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,650
I'm sorry via I'm sorry for

198
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,920
everything happening right now. I know it's a lot. I I should have listened.

199
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,360
I just want to go home

200
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,210
but home doesn't even feel like home anymore.

201
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,560
You ruined it.

202
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,200
You need to understand

203
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,160
your mother and I

204
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,050
I just

205
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,460
I felt

206
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,450
mhm.

207
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,760
She has always been

208
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,450
I haven't been that

209
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,850
we weren't in.

210
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,980
I'm sorry. I don't have the words.

211
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,360
Are you going to run off with him?

212
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,060
Believe me behind.

213
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,250
Go away Where?

214
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,160
I can't find you. What?

215
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,450
No,

216
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,360
no, no, never. I'd never do that.

217
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,860
Never.

218
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:05,960
I think it's time to leave this place. You were right. You are too old for it anyway.

219
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:19,390
So what would you like to do now can we go to stylish of coals?

220
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:24,750
They sell weird taxidermy there. Mm. Okay,

221
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,260

222
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,860
You're a guy sometimes. Thank you via. Thank you.

223
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:44,960
