00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,050
Mhm

1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,320
Howdy! I'm cleanest! Welcome to heaven.

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,490
If you did something good to get here and

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,960
good people deserve to give loved ones special blessings.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,560
Does it make you want to cry

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,370
when your face is turning blue, luckily for you, there's something we can do.

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,790
We can help keep them alive.

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,750
Are you beat now? We never even scott B

8
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,970
and we're here for all of us.

9
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,960
Nice one, baby.

10
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,750
Give me another mock

11
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,860

12
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,950
Uh huh keep going, keep going, keep going. I see, I see. Are you looking to get work?

13
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,480
Making crazy contraptions and goofy gadgets?

14
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,150
Well,

00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,180

17
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:20,460
I'm very desperate bingo

18
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,660
on the road

19
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,050
guys,

20
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:28,060
do you feel that? Oh shit, is that a hail shake? That's possible. All right,

21
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:33,450
don't panic, moxie, I'm not panicking because how quakes don't happen.

22
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,350
Stop getting hysterical fatty.

23
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:43,910
Who do not be afraid. Please tell me you got that insurance thing. How are you?

24
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,820
And what do you want to have you

25
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,820
dusted the inventor of all things Loopy and

26
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,560
got to just use the door. Dude

27
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,390
doesn't need to be this whole thing.

28
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,660
I am eccentric and must therefore too eccentric shit.

29
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:04,320
Oh, this old fuck reeks of the living world. Did you just die this moments ago.

30
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,250
In fact, Which is what brought me? Yeah, just saying

31
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,820
the front door would have gotten you here. Shut up dear furry!

32
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,380
This is the man I'm gonna need you to kill?

33
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,110
Not even a ship's length of time in hell and already plotting revenge.

34
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,590
I gotta respect a man with that sort of passion. I'm blitz the O is silent. What?

35
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:28,720
Oh no, thank you. Now what's the tcs fatigue guys help? Why are we killing this guy?

36
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:35,590
I mean, what did he do to you see, he was my business partner. You see,

37
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,360
I was not always an old man.

38
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:46,790
My partner, Lyle and I ran lyle. You be robotics. A technological empire.

39
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,290
Earlier today we were testing a new machine

40
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,500
intended to stop or reverse the aging process.

41
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,560
That could have seen the whole three trillion.

42
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,890
There's unfortunately we neglected to test the machine

43
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,160
on the poor like we usually do.

44
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,290
We were too sure of our own genius,

45
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:10,560
but the machine was accidentally set forward by the time we managed to get out

46
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,430
it was too late.

47
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,210
At least for me.

48
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,740
Yeah.

49
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:19,950
Mhm.

50
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:26,660
Now that evil son of a bitch is going to take over the empire we built together

51
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,190
without me to share it with.

52
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,620
You make all the goddamn money in the world and

53
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:35,350
become the fourth trillionaire and get all the credit.

54
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,450
That's not really evil. It's evil towards me.

55
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,860
Everything

56
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,900
he's going dot.

57
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,540
Now get your crimson asses up above and send that heartless

58
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,270
No good son of a bitch bell where he belongs.

59
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,900
You do know poopy Loopy.

60
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,850
Of course, of course if we do kill him though and he ends up down here.

61
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,460
You know, you will be stuck with him forever. Trust me. Yes,

62
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,360
I'm counting on it. That's gonna hot.

63
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,140
Yeah,

64
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,630
gee, I wonder whose house this is Until you're right.

65
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:17,890
Is the home of famous inventor, lyle Lipton. Ooh, let's do it gang.

66
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:22,350
Let's kill this rich guy.

67
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,790
And here you'll find three tacky stalkers about to attempt a murder.

68
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,760
Things like this could happen to famous people all the time.

69
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,040
Yeah,

70
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:45,180
wow, That machine really did a number on him. Goodbye. My one true love.

71
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,710
All the riches of the world can't fill the emptiness.

72
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:54,220
I'm feeling now that my shitty old body can't do anything of value.

73
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,480
How fantastic he's gonna do our job for us.

74
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,160
Uh

75
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,460
Should we go in there and tie it for him?

76
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:07,660
Yeah.

77
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,450
Mhm.

78
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,090
Yeah.

79
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,630
No, Lord. I'm being haunted by ugly often Children now. Who the fuck are they?

80
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:27,490
Oh no, sir. Those are Karen's Mr lyle. I hate filthy stinking often.

81
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,700
Children were here to convince you not to kill yourself sir.

82
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,660
To grant you a blessing on behalf of those in heaven

83
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,360
benefited by your amazing

84
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:39,260
technological advances. Oh, hell no!

85
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,760
Don't receive.

86
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,560
Fly a Lipton. It is our

87
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,930
humble opinion that you should continue the process to commit die.

88
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,550
I mean, what do you expect to do with all this money now? You're old and gross.

89
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,390
Is that a serious question?

90
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,180
He could help spread his wealth around with the people of the

91
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,970
world and do so much good with it and be so fulfilled.

92
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,890
No, he could pay for new hospitals and schools. Why won't you let me die?

93
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,990
I'll sounds like you need help often yourself there buddy, moxie.

94
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,060
What have we got for this fella?

95
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,290
I have some assault weapons, crossbow, hunting, bow, Tommy gun,

96
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,960
old fashioned shotgun, revolvers and three colours.

97
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,460
James, scott, honesty's classier than that.

98
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,840
There are still plenty of reasons to live. Mr lyle.

99
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:28,360
Yeah right smells like he ain't been out of bed in months.

100
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:37,940
Let's can be beautiful at any age and we'll show him. Yeah, look around last.

101
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:44,100
God's gift of nature is a wonder to behold regardless of age or well

102
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:48,360
if you were to end your life you'd be missing all of this.

103
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,360
You're gonna buy that load of shit from a baby and the sheep. It fucks.

104
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:59,030
That is so inappropriate. Kiss our ass! Prude! Anyway, take it from me.

105
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,160
A fellow genius. Nature is no picnic up close.

106
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,650
Oh

107
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:06,890
stop,

108
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,010
I can't stop. I

109
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,410
want to die more than I do.

110
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,960
Let's check out some places.

111
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:34,490
Oh Lord! Where are we? Now? Let me perish. We're here to show you another thing.

112
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:39,030
Life is worth. Living for childhood of wonderment. Why

113
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,950
look at those sweet, disease ridden vermin.

114
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,560
Their joy comes from innocence unspoiled by the burdens of a dog hood

115
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,150
and their middle class existence. Such simple joy they have.

116
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,160
It is inspiring.

117
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,150
Thank you for showing me this. Hey dipshit.

118
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,650
I want to see whose lap you're sitting on?

119
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,240
Uh huh.

120
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:02,860
Mhm

121
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,850
Oh,

122
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,150
this place reeks of teenagers.

123
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,400
Lover's lookout, sir.

124
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:21,150
We're here to remind you about possibly life's greatest enjoyable money. No

125
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,560
love. I've never been in love before,

126
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:29,910
I imagine it's quite nice. It's not too late, sir. You can still find fat.

127
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:35,049
Nice, try ugly. Hey, horny lovers. Which one of you would fuck this old man.

128
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:35,950
Mhm.

129
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,309
You know, you three are so utterly cruel.

130
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,590
We're just trying to give hope to someone in need.

131
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,290
Oh and you three are so superior to us.

132
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,990
Just because we want some selfish, greedy,

133
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,780
authoritarian capitalist to keel over dead.

134
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,850
You're making things too real Now, moxie

135
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:08,350
behold the wonder of art and music, something always there to comfort,

136
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,320
entertain and live for.

137
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:17,060
So how do we make this bad? We can't There's literally nothing bad about opera.

138
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,470
That's fact. Unless we ruin it somehow.

139
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,440
He's not very good.

140
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,950
Yeah.

141
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:49,110
Oh at least we made it bad that I had it.

142
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,620
You three monsters have messed with us and us too. We're just trying to do a job.

143
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,670
Well, so are we?

144
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,320
We are saving that shitty old man's life whether he wanted or not.

145
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,470
Well, someone wants that fucker dead. Okay.

146
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:09,780
And he paid in advance and I spent it all on this so he's gotta go Yeah,

147
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,540
all such disgusting loathsome feast.

148
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:17,050
Your kind is nothing but dirt that shetty dead people dread on

149
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,050
And now you're trying to meddle with the lines of him?

150
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,520
How are you?

151
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:28,160
So why don't you shut your trap, you judgmental cotton candy tin having bitch.

152
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:28,910
Selfie.

153
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,660
It's all starting to make sense. Now

154
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,710
life is worth living because we only get one.

155
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,560
We must cherish it

156
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,760
if creatures far beyond this living world are going through these legs over my life

157
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,760
and suddenly it's worth living.

158
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,380
Killing myself is not the answer.

159
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:16,350
Plus

160
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,870
I'm still rich,

161
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,960
I could just buy all the things

162
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,450
I no longer crave. Gods.

163
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,140
Yeah.

164
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,710
Oh

165
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,500
brother.

166
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:46,860
Okay.

167
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,060
Yeah,

168
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,260
wow.

169
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,040
Yeah.

170
00:11:53,040 --> 00:12:00,520
Well, well would you look at that? You did our job for us.

171
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:05,800
Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my God. Get hold of yourself. Calling.

172
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:10,860
I do not use the Lord's name in vain. This isn't over.

173
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,450
Mhm.

174
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:22,670
Yeah. No, sorry cletus. But I'm afraid your actions resulted in the death of a human.

175
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:33,560
I'm afraid you can't reenter heaven. Yeah, No. Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah. No.

176
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,460
Is there

177
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:46,740
anything we can do? Yeah, no, no, no, no. Oh no. What? We didn't need to. We never.

178
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,160
It was all

179
00:12:48,940 --> 00:13:00,550
anyway. Sorry guys. But those are the rules. Yeah. Way.

180
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,870
Well, the old man wanted to live again and we didn't kill him so we failed.

181
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,760
Thanks to those fucking cherubs. He's probably up in heaven now. So

182
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,450
it's a shame. All our client wanted was eternal revenge on his business partner.

183
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,370
And now the two are forever separated?

184
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,850
And now we got to face the fire of fucking up sir. When are you going to tell?

185
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,190
The client already sent him a text and we're in good hands his text.

186
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,060
Don't make people angry.

187
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,260
Mhm

188
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:27,650

00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,150
Lofa, we can explain everything. I was

190
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:40,160
lyle lifting. I don't understand. We thought you went to heaven heaven.

191
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,440
They don't make millions in technological advances and

192
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,060
robotics by not experimenting on the poor.

193
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,730
So you know, good heartless son of a bitch.

194
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,070
Thank you for reuniting me with my best friend.

195
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,090
The only question now is what do two old

196
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:02,760

197
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,090
