0
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:06,750
Mhm.

1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,240
I love this song

2
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,610
hair.

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,380
Holy shit.

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,850
How you suck for life. Do you listen up? You want to know pink conduct you?

5
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:30,760
God.

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,510
Oh shit

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,060
Rosica,

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,700
let's so I should have known you'd be here, I can smell fish for miles,

9
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,980
which is odd because I believe the nearest ocean is three rings down and

10
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,140
I should have known you'd be here when I heard the amber alerts.

11
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,480
Oh yeah, I'm surprised to get your fat ass out of rehab.

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,040
I can see you're still a drunken whore clutching onto that Bielsa juice bottle.

13
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,500
Like it's the last cock in hell.

14
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:04,670
They let me out because I'm still famous and rehab is for sad loser wash ups.

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,440
So your sister says, hi, why are you parking here?

16
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,350
This is the only parking spot my company has.

17
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,440
So take your tampon race car somewhere else actually, Prick,

18
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,360
it has my name on it.

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,690
I'm doing a bit of freelance for one of

20
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,610
the infinitely more successful companies in the building.

21
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,050
No,

22
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,350
they would have you come in this week to lead their team during spring break a week?

23
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,340
No, no, you are not parking here for a fucking week, You matt.

24
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,860
Let's so you're gonna run off leaving someone else to pay for the hotel room,

25
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,480
Steal their car and run three racetrack and

26
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,400
max my credit cards on shitty horse lessons.

27
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:46,960
Goddammit whore. You will not let that go choke on a sandpaper cock.

28
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,300
Yeah,

29
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,060
hold on, You better move that pussy wagon right now or I'm gonna,

30
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:59,050
you would, or I'll call Hr

31
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,430
anyway, me and my new hellhound Vortex.

32
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,960
Unlike you, He actually does his job well, to, to fuck stain.

33
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,950
I wasted so much time with a bag of holes like that. You know? Veronica made a

34
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,690
Oh yeah, I heard, Yeah, we dated. Was it before or after? She became a pop star.

35
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,300
You dated a pop star? Okay. Why are you all acting like That's such a shock. Hello.

36
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,760
It's veronica Mayday. It's you. I just she blind

37
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,150
suffering some form of brain damage.

38
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,710
Okay, look, you are all making this into a way bigger deal than it needs to be.

39
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:39,610
I don't pry into your stupid personal lives. You do that. Do that, sir.

40
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,080
Well, the sex with her. Like do we what? It's a pop star.

41
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,660
You want to know what sex with Michael. Crawford was like,

42
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,010
touche. Okay, look, let's just drop it.

43
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,180
Really find a temporary spot for that truck. Okay, Looney moxie.

44
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,320
Let's go handle this shit. Do you think they saw me?

45
00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:01,520
Fuck, I did my makeup shitty today. You look perfect Loony like always. Shut up tech.

46
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,720
Oh, let's

47
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:03,550
why?

48
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,650
Uh huh.

49
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,660
Oh

50
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,860
wow.

51
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,860
A big man with your bitch bag of an employer. She's in her office.

52
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,160
There wasn't room on the second floor. So they rented one here on this one

53
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,660
cheapest. Oh, come on.

54
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,560
Sorry man. Oh no, you don't bitch. How about you?

55
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,600
Let me go in and try to reason with her.

56
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:32,160
I don't really listen to what's classified as pop genre music.

57
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,000
So girls status to me is

58
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,100
riveted.

59
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,290
Shut the fuck up. All righty then.

60
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:42,640
Yeah.

61
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,980
Hello Miss Farrah sica. Was it?

62
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,160
I work for imp and it is actually rather important for us to retain

63
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,250
the singular parking space we were assigned because look at the little one.

64
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:58,000
He's got a widow Botha. Please don't condescend me, ma'am.

65
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:03,060
I want to kiss your little guy a kind offer, but

66
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:09,260
I'm married. Hey, why don't you send a little message from me back to your limp dick

67
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,590
boss.

68
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,360
You got

69
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,850
Mopti Don't let her access any of your home.

70
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,760
I gotta go lie down now.

71
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,050
Oh, this won't stand.

72
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,060
All right.

73
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,800
That's it.

74
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,810
If you're going to be shitty to my employees,

75
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,560
then I challenge you to a fucking challenge.

76
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,250
Fuck, I said that twice.

77
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:41,160
Mm. Is this in boy starting a demon duel? I think he is.

78
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,560
What's the game then blitz?

79
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,730
So every year you STD spreaders go up top side for easy pickings

80
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,750
while Spring break is a prime time for crime of all kinds.

81
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,080
So I bet you suck.

82
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:58,280
You bitches can't fuck as many people as we can off by the end of the day.

83
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:03,060
Oh, you're serious.

84
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,560
Game on bitch.

85
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,870
All right. Shut your assholes. Here's how we're gonna do this shit.

86
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,050
First we find a fuck ton appliance. We portal up. We have our fun murder time.

87
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,130
As per usual. We pile all the bodies into a big fucking canoe.

88
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,320
We push said canoe into some water.

89
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:25,110
We light it on fire to attract the sharks and ego shit. Maybe a goose to fuck it.

90
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,320
They come and eat the bodies.

91
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:31,110
We win the bet, we rub it in that sloppy bitches, drunken whore ass face.

92
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,870
Do you have any question? Uh yeah, Why was that nonsense? That wasn't a question.

93
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,770
That wasn't a plan.

94
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,220
I'm sorry, but that was a flawless presentation of what we should do,

95
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,400
mox It's not my fault.

96
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,180
You got a smooth little brain upstairs right now. I'm calling you slow moxie.

97
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,990
God, why don't you learn to take criticism? You talentless baby dick troll.

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,940
Well why don't you take an art class? Why don't you see how expensive they are?

99
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,540
Hey, is there a way I can come with you guys this time. Absolutely not.

100
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,470
I forbid it not gonna happen. Sorry, sweetie.

101
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,180
Spring break is no place for young, vulnerable. Got girls.

102
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:08,360
You know, the kind of freaks up there who drool all over you?

103
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,670
Well, I can blend in with humans easy enough. Just let me tag along.

104
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,660
Wait, say that again. I can blend in. Do you have a human discuss? Yeah, don't you?

105
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,240
Yeah,

106
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,910
you three have been screwing around on earth

107
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,570
this whole fucking time without human disguises.

108
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,760
Okay, new plan

109
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,760
Looney can help lure the humans to us and we'll take care of the rest.

110
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,070
Okay, how about that? Wallace logic.

111
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,630
I think you're missing the biggest issue sir,

112
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,850
isn't it crucial to have a client who demands enough kills to win this bet

113
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,060
we are just going up to massacre. I got that covered mocks.

114
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,640
Now we wait, sir.

115
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,080
There is no way we are going to get enough clients by

116
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,960
the end of the day with one poorly spelled bad grammar flyer.

117
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,560
Now, who's first?

118
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,260
Okay,

119
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,000
remember we can't be seen. Alright. And loose shots will likely cause a panic.

120
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,170
So luna can help with leading targets to a better spot to offer them. You got the list.

121
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,350
Loony

122
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,650
got it.

123
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:30,150
Hello honey, look at you. You look downright awful. I am so proud now bitch.

124
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:32,750
Mhm

125
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,850
understand you.

126
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,420
Yeah,

131
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:45,960
mhm

132
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:46,650
mhm

133
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,140
Yeah,

134
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:59,660
that's nine kills in the bag. I'd like to see that whaley snatch orgasm. That many

135
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,430
free breakers. Y'all ready to get fucked up and make some bitches bitch.

00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,460
What?

137

This is your final boarding call.

138
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,990
All aboard.

139
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,130
Thanks

140
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,100

142
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,950

144
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,560
down.

145
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:50,760
Goddamn it. That bitch started her goldfish mating call now.

146
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,070
She's gonna win all these sex maniacs. We gotta pick things up guys

147
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,770
on the list. Loony, Huh? Yeah, I think so.

148
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,260

00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:06,640
Whoa, whoa. What are you? Leper con? Yeah, pretty cool. Huh.

But you sure as shit. Ain't gonna tell nobody. All right. Next one.

00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,460
Come on buddy.

152
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,050
What? Where's my baby?

153
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,650
Does it smell?

154
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,050
You're nice.

155
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,300
No.

156
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,440
Yeah.

157
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,750

I mean like literally, you know, because vortexes, you know, they give off heat.

165
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,550
Probably right. Yeah,

166
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,560
I guess.

167
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,710
But my friends call me tex.

168
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:29,740
Oh yeah, I wish I had friends. I mean, I don't have friends.

169
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,010
Am I interrupting something? No man.

170
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:39,150
Just having a conversation, conversation leads to HPV and we've lost him.

171
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,080
It's looking like it's up to us to handle this list. Hell yeah.

172
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:48,250
Team in the name of getting shit done making the money.
