00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,150
Mhm

1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:03,350
Mhm

2
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:17,250
Right there. This was the first sighted, they are definitely from hell.

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,150
They must use this dark magic to cross over into our world

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,510
and they seem to be killing specifically targeted people?

5
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:30,260
But why they always attack at random all over the country?

6
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,860
There's no way to predict where they'll show up next.

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,190
Oh well that's convenience.

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,610
Remember we can't be seen part of my words, sir,

9
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,600
but you're currently being the loudest.

10
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,630
I said, shut your dick sucking lips, moxie.

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,650
Yeah,

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,260
luna hold it

13
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,640
calories

14
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:24,250
back off you tuxedo wearing bucks.

15
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,060
I'd like to see the suits and corporate calling us losers. Now,

16
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,280
that was pretty bad ass.

17
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,760
Super bad ass.

18
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,560
Mhm.

19
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:52,570
Shit. Shit. Shit shit. Uh You okay there? What are you doing? Sitting there?

20
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,960
The boys are in trouble opening the can blitz was

21
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,780
using a total of zero euphemisms innuendos or swears.

22
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,850
That means it was serious.

23
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,060
Which means I don't open it until open the fucking part now.

24
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,560
Oh

25
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,259
yeah,

26
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,450
they aren't here.

27
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,150
Mhm.

28
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:21,050
It smells like they went this way. Come on, Let's find the dumb ass twins.

29
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,350
Mm hmm.

30
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,560
Uh huh.

31
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,360
Uh huh.

32
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:34,340
Finally awake, huh? Little fella, Your papa has been for a while now look shit bag.

33
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,080
It takes a lot to keep me down. All right.

34
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,660
I took a fuck ton of tranquilizers in the college I dropped

35
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,370
out of Also I've been strapped nipple first to a car battery.

36
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,650
So okay. Tell a steaming scum.

37
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,610
Who do you work for? Satan? How did you get to our world from the afterlife.

38
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,760
Why use killing humans. When did you show up here?

39
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,250
Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there bitch.

40
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:53,910
First of all,

41
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,320
we just woke up from a very nasty shock and I'm still feeling fucking woozy.

42
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,230
So I'm gonna request that. Just some coffee before we get into this.

43
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,380
I mean everyone gets coffee and shitty movies with scenes like this. All right.

44
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,650
I want something iced bitch marks. I'll have a Neopolitan cappuccino.

45
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,360
More cappuccino. Make sure it's got no more than four ounces of milk.

46
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,360
The beans won't have the right texture otherwise.

47
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,210
And make sure they spell my name correctly on the cup. They always put foxy roxy.

48
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,010
I hate that if you can't handle that,

49
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,100
I'll have a venti traditional misto Please use soy milk with two blonde shots.

50
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,850
I forgot him and restrict out.

51
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,490
I'd also love three vanilla pumps at the very bottom, then add the coffee after then.

52
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:32,140
And now we are getting his coffee, wow, I was getting massive douche chills.

53
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,750
Just their marks. Congrats.

54
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,730
If we have to We are willing to resort to torture

55
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,150
methods to get answers out of you nasty hail beasts.

56
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,710
When you say to our church, you mean physical or psychological.

57
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,960
Physical seems counterproductive.

58
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,910
We would likely tell you anything if it meant an end

59
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,960
to the pain and you would have no way of knowing

60
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,420
what was true or we might like it too much And

61
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,060
then you've got a whole new thing to deal with.

62
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,840
What do you mean by that? You're stupid, huh? I could work with stupid daddy.

63
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,860
Likey dummy.

64
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,770
You can relax,

65
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,840
dad! You better stop laughing at it. Yeah, you are the ones at our mercy.

66
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,810
It's hard to resist. I'm really sorry.

67
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,220
I mean, considering your approach thus far, you've had us tight here for what?

68
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,550
Hours? And you haven't even had us confirm what exactly we are. What are you?

69
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,750
I'm a Virgo. A smart guy.

70
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,150
More quip out of you and we'll shut you up. Getting kinky.

71
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,980
We aren't playing any of vile demon kinks.

72
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,740
I mean, that's what it sounded like back there. You're sick.

73
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:37,400
Oh, please don't give them ideas, sir. Why not? I know the shit you're into.

74
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,490
We are not getting kinky with you, calm down one. Don't let these monsters get to you.

75
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,590
Hey, are we going to get our phone call, bitch? Well, that entirely depends.

76
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:53,900
Who are you going to call your fat mom? Thanking her for a fat time. Nice try demon.

77
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,860
His fat mom is. Dad

78
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,190
is where they ended up, I think so. Fuck, this looks intense.

79
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,050
How are we going to get in, lift me up to that vent?

80
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,460
Mhm.

81
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,560
Yeah.

82
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,770
Damn.

83
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:52,690
You're pretty agile for an old lady. I'm like five years older than you.

84
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,210
Stop insulting my mother. She's dead. Hey?

85
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,260
Let's just leave them here until they feel like talking

86
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:00,950
When?

87
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:01,500
Yeah,

88
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,000
don't worry marks. If we keep being obnoxious.

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,360
They'll eventually slip up and we'll get a chance to get out.

90
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,160
Let's just keep fucking with them until they get so frustrated.

91
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,850
They stop thinking clearly. It usually works. Hmm.

92
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,840
So the demons want to play games, huh?

93
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,460
Well we can play games.

94
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,860
I'm just worried about Millie. She'll be on her way by now.

95
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,080
I'm sure she'll be fine, moxie.

96
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,320
It would take a roided up hippo to take down that woman when she's upset.

97
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,820
We've never dealt with the human government before. She's in danger.

98
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:43,240
Do you ever honestly shut up about Millie? It's always, Oh, how's Millie?

99
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,310
I can't tonight. I'm hanging with Millie.

100
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,120
I'm still worried about Millie and she's always five fucking feet away from you.

101
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,050
It's pathetic.

102
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,760
That was oddly personal. You're right.

103
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,250
I don't know why the fuck I just let my guts spill like that.

104
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,190
Sir.

105
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,760
They're filling this room with something. Fuck hell is this?

106
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,330
I think it's some kind of airborne truth telling Sarah.

107
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,210
Oh, you just guess that's what it is. Well, just ask me something specific.

108
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,870
I wouldn't normally tell you. Okay,

109
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:19,050
this. Milly ever pegged you sometimes. Wait you. Fuck, why that I knew it.

110
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,750
Your suit is tacky. Fuck. I'm sorry.

111
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:30,350
How fucking dare you. You have shitty taste in music. I'm sorry. Shit. Taste.

112
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,280
You said you liked that musical. I recommended to you. I lied.

113
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:38,770
I left halfway through. You said you loved it. It was awful moxie.

114
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,940
It was about ugly, horny cat.

115
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,960
I think I've said so many lives.

116
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,660
This is gonna be a good night.

117
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:52,760
Oh

118
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,850
damn it moxie? This is all your fault? How is this my fault?

119
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:00,660
Mhm.

120
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,140
Yeah,

121
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:18,250
blitz. I can't see you. God, this smells awful. What's that music? Is that you?

122
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:24,060
Is this a prank? Because I swear this. It is no prank bitch. Hey,

123
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,830
why do you sound like that? Because you my precious little bitch boy.

124
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:35,179
Stop it, tripping balls. Know what? How could this be?

125
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,650
I've never tried to ask the truth or D. M. T. It's a bad trip.

126
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,960
Like a vault. Of course blitz. This would be your fault.

127
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:50,880
My lungs are full of honesty. Would you promise me that you won't judge?

128
00:08:50,890 --> 00:09:00,400
Not trying to divulge too much, but I'm in too deep. So first of all, fuck you.

129
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,540
This is just typical.

130
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,980
Well two can play at this game of

131
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,800
despair because if you're here causing frustration,

132
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,050
I'm torturing you in your hallucination.

133
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:10,650
Mm.

134
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:11,750
Yeah.

135
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:28,820
I simply follow your orders. It is it my fault?

136
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,660
If your orders are as non sensible as a son panning

137
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,520
left out on the

138
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,720
porch of refreshing?

139
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,160
Why are you talking like that? What the fuck does that even mean?

140
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,810
I am simply speaking state of plain english?

141
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,600
Perhaps don't crack open a dictionary sometime

142
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,350
and then maybe you can understand

143
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,400
top of the privileged thing by getting all and an all

144
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,870
around on my system and the last one on top.

145
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:50,940
Yeah.

146
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,260
Shut up.

147
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,830
Why do you hurt me? I know why

148
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,520
I push my friends.

149
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:07,150
Why does it seem like a recurring thing that you alienate with your toxic routine.

150
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,500
Don't know. Eventually everyone is your thoughtless and ruin.

151
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,280
You'll end up alone every my

152
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,510
You don't know what you are doing half the time.

153
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,880
And you depend on me and the missus to manage your foolish flights of fancy.

154
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,040
You can do this

155
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,980
on my own.

156
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,260
Yes.

157
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:27,970
What

158
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,770
you're trying to

159
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,050
get you still shove away anyone who gets too close

160
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,210
until they resent me for being a selfish shit.

161
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,190
Are you afraid?

162
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,020
I've

163
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,030
found consciousness trying to tell you that

164
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,890
you simply cannot fathom proper intimacy,

165
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,420
but also craving as well.

166
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,550
It's rather unfortunate sir,

167
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,910
considering it's often how you treat those who stand by you such as myself.

168
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,710
Are you worried? I may have enough of it one day as well.

169
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,910
Stop fucking talking all of you.

170
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:57,790
Why maxie? Why have you held your true feelings inside? A rejection?

171
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:04,600
Must see why do you have merely put it in your book? Gives me an erection

172
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:14,770
a to why we accept your true feelings. So promise me that I can do to be true.

173
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:20,460
The world is your brain is so pegan with honesty. I've been a jackass.

174
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:29,160
It's true in a Jackass. It's true as we're back as ourselves. I will be a better friend

175
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,860
then I was before.

176
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,960
Be better at speaking my mom

177
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:46,760
together. We can begin to become

178
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:52,650

179
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,760

00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,650
Yeah.

183
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,650
Do you remember what you said to me after my first day with the company?

184
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,390
Not really.

185
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,460
I remember

186
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,710
he told me I did a good job and

187
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,460
that you were proud to work with me.

188
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,350
I feel like you wanted to say something more judgmental. But

189
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,760
he said that because I needed it

190
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:46,450
and it helped look, I'm hard on you because I know what you're capable of mox

191
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,040
you care too much about what everyone thinks except

192
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,590
for me because you know my opinion is correct,

193
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,280
but just keep doing a good job.

194
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:57,350
Okay, You shoot and kill good. You escape things easy.

195
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,610
You could be strategic and cold blooded when you

196
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,460
need to and don't expect any more compliments.

197
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,260

217
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,190
